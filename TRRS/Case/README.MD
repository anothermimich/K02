# Ultra low profile acrylic case

| Quantity | What                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 2        | laser cut acrylic 2mm of each file\* |
| 2        | heat insert M2(OD 3.2mm) 2mm lenght  |

\*The laser kerf need to be ajusted. You can use inkscape offset path effect to do that based on the kerf value provided by the manufacture.

## What is left to do

Add recess for the rubber feet. The best option is to do this based on the rubber feet you find, i suggest 8mm x 3mm.
