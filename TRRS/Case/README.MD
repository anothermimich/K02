# Acrylic case

This case has two versions. The **full** version will add 2mm to the board height. The **lite** version don't add any height to the board.

For both versions the laser kerf need to be ajusted. You can use inkscape offset path effect to do that based on the kerf value provided by the manufacture.

## How to make it better

You can add recess for the rubber feet. The best option is to do this based on the rubber feet you find, i suggest 10mm x 3mm.
