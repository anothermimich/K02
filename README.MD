**Less, but better.** - Dieter Rams

This is a parcial redesign of the [Ferris Sweep 2 half-swept](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep).

### The main changes that have been done are:

- Change pcb overall form.
- Add support screw holes.
- Add teardrop on solder joints.
- Reposition of the reset and power switch.
- Remove all the informative silk graphics for a better looking board.
- Add commissioned art by the brazilian artist [Aline Dal Pont](https://www.instagram.com/manifesto.efemero/).
- Create an alternative version with `USB-C` instead of `TRRS`.

### What I plan on doing:

- Change the power switch to something better build. _I accept suggestions_.
- Do an extensive and compreensive assembly manual.
- Design a _minimalist_ and _low profile_ case to be laser cut in acrylic.
- Create an bluetooth dongle with e-ink display and media control functions.

## Versions

At the moment this repo contains 2 versions, one with `TRRS` and one with `USB-C` connecting the halves. Both pcbs are untested, I advise you to review them before production.

The list of materials for each version will be added inside of the respective folder.

## Silk art

I commissioned the work of a local artist for this board. You can remove the work completely or leave it as it is with the credits. You cannot use the work outside of this board or modify it in any way without the express autorization of the artist.
