### Less, but better.

#### Dieter Rams

This is a parcial redesign of the half [ferris sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) pcb.

#### The main changes that have been done are:

- Remove pcb margins.
- Add support screw holes.
- Add teardrop on solder joints.
- Reposition of the reset and power switch.
- Remove all the silk graphics for a better looking board minimal.

#### What I plan on doing:

- Design a _minimalist_ case for FTM print.
- Design a _minimalist_ case for laser cut acrylic or metal.
- Do an extensive and compreensive assembly manual.

## Silk art

Be creative. In the folder `Silk mockup` there are a mockup of the board, print it and draw your custom silk art.
