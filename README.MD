**Less, but better.** - Dieter Rams

This is a parcial redesign of the half [ferris sweep 2](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) pcb.

### The main changes that have been done are:

- Remove pcb margins.
- Add support screw holes.
- Add teardrop on solder joints.
- Reposition of the reset and power switch.
- Remove all the silk graphics for a better looking board minimal.

### What I plan on doing:

- Change the power switch to something better.
- Change the TRRS to USB-C.
- Do an extensive and compreensive assembly manual.
- Design a _minimalist_ case for FTM print, resin and laser cut acrylic or metal.

## Versions

At the moment this repo contains 2 versions, one with `TRRS` and one with `USB-C` connecting the halves. Both pcbs are untested, I advise you to review them before production.

The list of materials for each version will be added inside of the respective folder.

## Silk art

Be creative. In the folder `Silk mockup` there are a mockup of the board, print it and draw your custom silk art.
