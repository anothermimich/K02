**Less, but better.** - Dieter Rams

After seeing the [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) for the first time I've fallen in love with it, but as a designer I cannot accept the thinks the way they are. So I've done some experimentation with it.

I changed the overall form of the board so it can be a little bit more compact and give the impression that the keys are floating in the desk. This change also expand the posibilities of case design, for example, you can do some designs inspired in the [totem](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/TOTEM) aesthethic.

With this redesign I've taken every milimiter into account. As so the acrylic case released with the `TRRS` version counts with 2 versions, the full version adds 2mm to the board height, and the lite version adds 0mm.

Another important thing is that this is a parcial redesign of the [Ferris Sweep 2 half-swept](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep). In other words this is a:

- 34 keys.
- Diodeless.
- Low profile.
- Non-hotswap.
- Reversible PCB.
- Column staggered.
- Wireless and wired capable.
- Choc MBK spaced (17,5mm x 16,5mm).
- Cheaper than the [cheapino](https://github.com/tompi/cheapino) (at the time of the build).

### What have been done:

- Change PCB overall form.
- Add support screw holes.
- Add teardrop on solder joints.
- Reposition of the reset and power switch.
- Create an alternative version with `USB-C` instead of `TRRS`.
- Add commissioned art by the brazilian artist [Aline Dal Pont](https://www.instagram.com/manifesto.efemero/).
- Design a _minimalist_ and _low profile_ [case](/TRRS/Case/) to be laser cut in acrylic.
- Remove all the informative silk graphics for a better looking board.

### What I plan on doing:

- Add magnets to the case.
- Create an 36 keys pcb with breakpoints.
- Organize the case in two version, full and lite.
- Do an extensive and compreensive assembly manual.
- Add a variation with choc spacing for [CFX keycaps](https://kbd.news/CFX-keycap-1553.html) (16,5mm x 16,5mm).
- Change the power switch to something better build. _I accept suggestions_.
- Create an bluetooth dongle with e-ink display and media control functions.

## Versions

At the moment this repo contains 2 versions, one with `TRRS` and one with `USB-C` connecting the halves. In the community the TRRS connectors are not praised, due to causing shorts when unpluging it with the board powered on, but I still suggest you to use them. I suggest this due to the USB-C risk of being plugged directly to the computer. 

Both PCBs are untested, I advise you to review them before production.

The list of materials for each version are inside of the respective folder.

## Silk art

I commissioned the work of the brazilian artist [Aline Dal Pont](https://www.instagram.com/manifesto.efemero/) for this board. You can remove the work completely or leave it as it is with the credits. You cannot use the work outside of this board or modify it in any way without the express autorization of the artist.

## Firmware

As this redesign had only touched on aesthetic aspects, you can use the firmware from the [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep).

The team behind the design of the incredible [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) are: [Pierre Chevalier](https://github.com/pierrechevalier83), [David Barr](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr), [Ibnu Daru Aji](https://github.com/ibnuda/), [Duccio](https://github.com/duckyb). Without their work this parcial redesign would not be possible.
