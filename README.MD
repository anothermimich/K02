**Less, but better.** - Dieter Rams

This is a parcial redesign of the [Ferris Sweep 2 half-swept](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep).

In other words it's a:

- low profile
- 34 keys
- column staggered
- diodeless
- reversible pcb
- non-hotswap
- wireless and wired capable
- Cheaper than the [cheapino](https://github.com/tompi/cheapino) (at the time of the build)

### What have been done:

- Change pcb overall form.
- Add support screw holes.
- Add teardrop on solder joints.
- Reposition of the reset and power switch.
- Create an alternative version with `USB-C` instead of `TRRS`.
- Add commissioned art by the brazilian artist [Aline Dal Pont](https://www.instagram.com/manifesto.efemero/).
- Remove all the informative silk graphics for a better looking board.
- Design a _minimalist_ and _low profile_ [case](/TRRS/Case/) to be laser cut in acrylic.

### What I plan on doing:

- Do an extensive and compreensive assembly manual.
- Create an bluetooth dongle with e-ink display and media control functions.
- Change the power switch to something better build. _I accept suggestions_.
- Create an 36 keys pcb with breakpoints.

## Versions

At the moment this repo contains 2 versions, one with `TRRS` and one with `USB-C` connecting the halves. The version with `TRRS`Both pcbs are untested, I advise you to review them before production.

The list of materials for each version will be added inside of the respective folder.

## Silk art

I commissioned the work of a local artist for this board. You can remove the work completely or leave it as it is with the credits. You cannot use the work outside of this board or modify it in any way without the express autorization of the artist.

## Firmware

As this redesign had only touched on aesthetic aspects, you can use the firmware from the [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep).

The team behind the design of the incredible [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) are:

- [Pierre Chevalier](https://github.com/pierrechevalier83)
- [David Barr](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr)
- [Ibnu Daru Aji](https://github.com/ibnuda/)
- [Duccio](https://github.com/duckyb)

Without their work this parcial redesign would not be possible.
